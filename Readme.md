# Gesture Controlled Virtual Mouse

This project aims to implement a gesture-controlled virtual mouse using OpenCV, Mediapipe, PyAutoGUI, and other essential Python libraries. This software leverages real-time hand gesture recognition using Mediapipe hands to detect hands' motion and position.

## Features

- Recognizes hand gestures from camera input.
- Maps gestures to specific functions such as controlling mouse movements, clicks, right-clicks or double-clicks, making sound, and scrolling up/down or right/left.
- Provides options for custom mappings of gestures.
- Works with multi-hand input by detecting the predominant hand.
- Uses Mediapipe's pose estimation to localize hand and finger landmarks and track their movement.
- Applies dampening to stabilize mouse movements.
- Incorporates a pinch control mechanism for vertical scrolling or adjusting the system volume.
- Background color change option using hand gestures (thumbs up -> black & thumbs down -> white).
- Integrates with PyAudio to adjust sound levels based on pinch input.

### Optional Features

- Display the detected gesture label as text on the screen or a small overlay.
- Add more gestures to control other functionalities.
- Add a menu or setting to select the dominant hand and other options.
- Add audio feedback for different gestures, to indicate successful detection.
